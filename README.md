# Oblique Horrors

Oblique strategies for horror stories. First proposed by Mike Hoye (mhoye@bespokeio.com), 2023.

Browsing the (wonderful) itch.io, I wondered if there's an Oblique Strategies deck out there for horror/survival story or game creators that people were passing around. I don't think that's the case, but I suggested a few. 

Oblique Strategies - subtitled "Over One Hundred Worthwhile Dilemmas" - is a card-based method for spurring creativity inquiry and and getting around creative block created by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt, and was first published in 1975. 

If you'd like to suggest additions, contributions are welcome. The full list is in this respository, in the file named OBLIQUE-HORRORS.md
